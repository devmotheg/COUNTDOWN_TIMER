# Countdown Timer

>"Don't count the days. Make the days count."\
â€” Muhammad Ali

NGL, this project was very fun to do and taught me a lot about time and date.

## Features

- You can enter any valid date (must be ahead of now's date (an upcoming one)) that has a a difference of less than 999 days from now's date in multiple formats (either the provided one or a one that JS's `Date` class accepts).
