# Countdown Timer

>"Don't count the days. Make the days count."\
â€” Muhammad Ali

NGL, this project was very fun to do and taught me a lot about time and date; somethings to watch out for when trying this web-app:
- The entered date must be ahead of now's date (an upcoming one).
- The difference between the two dates shouldn't exceed 999 days.
- The date must follow a specific format (specifically the one provided or the one JS `Date` class uses).
